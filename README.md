# Java Trainer and Pok√©mon - JDBC CRUD Application üêæ

This is a simple console-based Java application using JDBC to manage Pok√©mon and their trainers. It supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both entities and includes several special features. The app demonstrates relational data handling with one-to-many and many-to-one relationships using a MySQL database.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/12Kubis12/java-trainer-and-pokemon.git

2. Database Initialization.
   -  Open your SQL client (MySQL) and use this SQL script to set up your database: [`src/main/resources/init.sql`](https://github.com/12Kubis12/java-trainer-and-pokemon/blob/main/src/main/resources/init.sql)
   -  The code in this file :
      - Creates the `trainers` and `pokemons` tables
      - Inserts example data into both tables
  
3. Create a new file named `application.properties` inside the resources directory:

   [`src/main/resources`](https://github.com/12Kubis12/java-trainer-and-pokemon/blob/main/src/main/resources)
   - Add the following content to the file, replacing YOUR_USER_NAME and YOUR_PASSWORD with your actual MySQL credentials:
   
      ```properties
      db.name=trainer_and_pokemon
      db.username=YOUR_USER_NAME
      db.password=YOUR_PASSWORD
      ```
      
5. In this file, replace the URL (`jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/`) with the appropriate connection string for your own database, if it's different (e.g. using a different host, port, or parameters):

   [`src/main/java/ParentPackage/db/HikariCPDataSource.java`](https://github.com/12Kubis12/java-trainer-and-pokemon/blob/main/src/main/java/ParentPackage/db/HikariCPDataSource.java)
   
    ```
    config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/" + prop.getProperty("db.name"));
    ```
      
7.  Build and run the application.

8. Follow the instructions in console.
